# F1App

This is just a fun project intended for use in context of the sport of Formula One.

This app is intended to be an easy to use database to look up information about F1 - thinking about integrating twitter api
allowing for users to tweet to their accounts to start threads, facilitate conversations, etc

Using 
- Ergast API - routes
- -> removed alamofire, no longer needed when using swift url session and json decoder
- Added Google Firebase
